GoesJoomla template framework for Joomla 2.5 series
===================================================

Hello everybody,

I am Manh-Cuong Nguyen, a 5-year experience Joomla extension developer. At the time of writting, i have stopped all of my Joomla-based businesses. So, i decide to release some of my very-near-to-complete Joomla 2.5 projects, under the GNU General Public License v3.0, which are:

* GJ Framework - a simple and flexible template framework for Joomla 2.5

This template framework, at its core, supports serving appropriated web design and content adaptation for different types of client devices including but not limited to desktop/laptop PC, tablet PC, smartphone and feature-phone.

* GJ Cereus - a sample Joomla 2.5 template created based on GJ Framework

This sample template is an upgrade for Joomla 2.5 of my well-known Rego template for Joomla 1.5 ( https://github.com/goesjoomla/JoomlaEZ.com/tree/templates/Rego ).

Please feel free to reuse my works for any purpose you like. If that purpose is prohibited by the GNU General Public License v3.0, simply contact me via goesjoomla@gmail.com for a solution.
